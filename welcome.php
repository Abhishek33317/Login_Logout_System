PHP Variables
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).
Rules for PHP variables:
A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

PHP is a Loosely Typed Language
In the example above 
notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.

PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable
depending on its value. 
Since the data types are not set in a strict sense 
you can do things like adding a string to an integer without causing an error.

In PHP 7, type declarations were added. 
This gives an option to specify the data type expected when declaring a function
and by enabling the strict requirement, it will throw a "Fatal Error" on a type mismatch.

You will learn more about strict and non-strict requirements, and data type declarations in the PHP Functions chapter.
